Solaris Package System
======================

This is an attempt, using pure `sh`, to create a software
building and packaging system for Solaris 10 (and maybe
other versions) on an UltraSPARC II system (my test system
is an Ultra 60).

It is based loosely around a combination of both Arch's
makepkg system and FreeBSD's ports tree.

It is very much a work in progress and liable to break any time.
